ParallelNet: Multi-Core Neural Network Operating System
Introduction
ParallelNet is an advanced operating system designed to harness the power of multi-core processors for accelerated training of neural networks. By implementing separate processes for each layer and utilizing threads for individual neurons, ParallelNet enables parallel processing and efficient resource utilization.

Purpose
The purpose of ParallelNet is to optimize the training process of neural networks by leveraging the capabilities of multi-core processors. By distributing computations across cores and facilitating inter-process communication, the operating system enables faster and more efficient neural network training.

Features
Parallel Processing: ParallelNet utilizes separate processes and threads to parallelize computations, leveraging the full potential of multi-core processors for enhanced performance.

Inter-Process Communication: The operating system incorporates pipes for efficient information exchange, allowing seamless communication of weights, biases, and other network parameters between processes during training.

Batch Processing: ParallelNet supports a batch-based approach, dividing input data into smaller batches and processing them concurrently, improving training speed and efficiency.

Resource Optimization: The system effectively manages resources by allocating memory to processes and threads, ensuring each has access to its own memory space to prevent conflicts.

Process Scheduling: ParallelNet implements efficient process scheduling techniques to maximize CPU utilization and maintain smooth operation during neural network training.
